### How to Run

This model is made using python3. So it is suggested to have python3 be already installed in the testing system.

If python3 is present in the PC, run the MalwareDetection.py by typing the following command in a terminal opened in the same folder of
MalwareDetection.py file.

	$ python3 MalwareDetection.py <Target_Directory_Path>

When the testing gets over, required output CSV file will be generated in the same forder as that of MalwareDetection.py
